  abstract = {Outlier detection is a statistical procedure that aims to find suspicious events or items that are different from the normal form of a dataset. It has drawn considerable interest in the field of data mining and machine learning. Outlier detection is important in many applications, including fraud detection in credit card transactions and network intrusion detection. There are two general types of outlier detection: global and local. Global outliers fall outside the normal range for an entire dataset, whereas local outliers may fall within the normal range for the entire dataset, but outside the normal range for the surrounding data points. This paper addresses local outlier detection. The best-known technique for local outlier detection is the Local Outlier Factor (LOF), a density-based technique. There are many LOF algorithms for a static data environment; however, these algorithms cannot be applied directly to data streams, which are an important type of big data. In general, local outlier detection algorithms for data streams are still deficient and better algorithms need to be developed that can effectively analyze the high velocity of data streams to detect local outliers. This paper presents a literature review of local outlier detection algorithms in static and stream environments, with an emphasis on LOF algorithms. It collects and categorizes existing local outlier detection algorithms and analyzes their characteristics. Furthermore, the paper discusses the advantages and limitations of those algorithms and proposes several promising directions for developing improved local outlier detection methods for data streams.},

  abstract = {For many KDD applications, such as detecting criminal activities in E-commerce, finding the rare instances or the outliers, can be more interesting than finding the common patterns. Existing work in outlier detection regards being an outlier as a binary property. In this paper, we contend that for many scenarios, it is more meaningful to assign to each object a               degree               of being an outlier. This degree is called the               local outlier factor               (LOF) of an object. It is               local               in that the degree depends on how isolated the object is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood. We give a detailed formal analysis showing that LOF enjoys many desirable properties. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that LOF can be used to find outliers which appear to be meaningful, but can otherwise not be identified with existing approaches. Finally, a careful performance evaluation of our algorithm confirms we show that our approach of finding local outliers can be practical.},
