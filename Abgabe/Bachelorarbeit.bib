It has drawn considerable interest in the field of data mining and machine learning. Outlier detection is important in many applications, including fraud detection in credit card transactions and network intrusion detection.

  abstract = {A sliding windows model is an important case of the streaming model, where only the most “recent” elements remain active and the rest are discarded. The sliding windows model is important for many applications (see, e.g., Babcock, Babu, Datar, Motwani and Widom (PODS 02); and Datar, Gionis, Indyk and Motwani (SODA 02)). There are two equally important types of the sliding windows model – windows with fixed size (e.g., where items arrive one at a time, and only the most recent n items remain active for some fixed parameter n), and timestamp-based windows (e.g., where many items can arrive in “bursts” at a single step and where only items from the last t steps remain active, again for some fixed parameter t). Random sampling is a fundamental tool for data streams, as numerous algorithms operate on the sampled data instead of on the entire stream. Effective sampling from sliding windows is a nontrivial problem, as elements eventually expire. In fact, the deletions are implicit; i.e., it is not possible to identify deleted elements without storing the entire window. The implicit nature of deletions on sliding windows does not allow the existing methods (even those that support explicit deletions, e.g., Cormode, Muthukrishnan and Rozenbaum (VLDB 05); Frahling, Indyk and Sohler (SOCG 05)) to be directly “translated” to the sliding windows model. One trivial approach to overcoming the problem of implicit deletions is that of over-sampling. When k samples are required, the over-sampling method maintains k′{$>$}k samples in the hope that at least k samples are not expired. The obvious disadvantages of this method are twofold:(a)It introduces additional costs and thus decreases the performance; and(b)The memory bounds are not deterministic, which is atypical for streaming algorithms (where even small probability events may eventually happen for a stream that is long enough). Babcock, Datar and Motwani (SODA 02), were the first to stress the importance of improvements to over-sampling. They formally introduced the problem of sampling from sliding windows and improved the over-sampling method for sampling with replacement. Their elegant solutions for sampling with replacement are optimal in expectation, and thus resolve disadvantage (a) mentioned above. Unfortunately, the randomized bounds do not resolve disadvantage (b) above. Interestingly, all algorithms that employ the ideas of Babcock, Datar and Motwani have the same central problem of having to deal with a randomized complexity bound (see, e.g., Datar and Muthukrishnan (ESA 02); Chakrabarti, Cormode and McGregor (SODA 07)). Further, the proposed solutions of Babcock, Datar and Motwani for sampling without replacement are based on the over-sampling method and thus do not solve problem (a). Therefore, the question of whether we can solve sampling on sliding windows optimally (i.e., resolve both disadvantages) is implicit in the paper of Babcock, Datar and Motwani and has remained open for all variants of the problem. In this paper we answer these questions affirmatively and provide optimal sampling schemas for all variants of the problem, i.e., sampling with or without replacement from fixed or timestamp-based windows. Specifically, for fixed-size windows, we provide optimal solutions that require O(k) memory; for timestamp-based windows, we show algorithms that require O(klogn) space,1 which is optimal since it matches the lower bound by Gemulla and Lehner (SIGMOD 08). In contrast to the work of Babcock, Datar and Motwani, our solutions have deterministic bounds.},

The second presents a number of network architectures that may be designed to match the general concepts of Parallel Distributed Processing with backpropagation learning. Finally, the third section shows how these principles can be applied to a number of different fields related to the cognitive sciences, including control, speech recognition, robotics, image processing, and cognitive psychology. The volume is designed to provide both a solid theoretical foundation and a set of examples that show the versatility of the concepts. Useful to experts in the field, it should also be most helpful to students seeking to understand the basic principles of connectionist learning and to engineers wanting to add neural networks in general -- and backpropagation in particular -- to their set of problem-solving methods.},

  abstract = {We present an extension to the model-free anomaly detection algorithm, Isolation Forest. This extension, named Extended Isolation Forest (EIF), resolves issues with assignment of anomaly score to given data points. We motivate the problem using heat maps for anomaly scores. These maps suffer from artifacts generated by the criteria for branching operation of the binary tree. We explain this problem in detail and demonstrate the mechanism by which it occurs visually. We then propose two different approaches for improving the situation. First we propose transforming the data randomly before creation of each tree, which results in averaging out the bias. Second, which is the preferred way, is to allow the slicing of the data to use hyperplanes with random slopes. This approach results in remedying the artifact seen in the anomaly score heat maps. We show that the robustness of the algorithm is much improved using this method by looking at the variance of scores of data points distributed along constant level sets. We report AUROC and AUPRC for our synthetic datasets, along with real-world benchmark datasets. We find no appreciable difference in the rate of convergence nor in computation time between the standard Isolation Forest and EIF.},

High-frequency MBESs provide a good horizontal resolution, making it possible to distinguish fine details at the water-seafloor interface. However, in order to accurately measure the seafloor influence on the backscattered energy, the recorded sonar data must first be processed and cleared of various artifacts generated by the sonar system itself. Such a preprocessing correction procedure along with the assessment of its validity limits is presented and applied to a 95-kHz MBES (Simrad EM 1000) data set. Beam pattern effects, uneven array sensitivities, and inaccurate normalization of the ensonified area are removed to make possible further quantitative analysis of the corrected backscatter images. Unlike low-frequency data where the average backscattered energy proves to be the only relevant feature for discriminating the nature of the seafloor, high-frequency MBES backscatter images exhibit visible texture patterns. This additional information involves different statistical distributions of the backscattered amplitudes obtained from various seafloor types. Non-Rayleigh statistics such as K-distributions are shown to fit correctly the skewed distributions of experimental high-frequency data. Apart from the effect of the seafloor micro-roughness, a statistical model makes clear a correlation between the amplitude statistical distributions and the signal incidence angle made available by MBES bathymetric abilities. Moreover, the model enhances the effect of the first derivative of the seafloor backscattering strength upon statistical distributions near the nadir and at high incidence angles. The whole correction and analysis process is finally applied to a Simrad EM 1000 data set.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Geomorphometry, the science of quantitative terrain characterization, has traditionally focused on the investigation of terrestrial landscapes. However, the dramatic increase in the availability of digital bathymetric data and the increasing ease by which geomorphometry can be investigated using geographic information systems (GISs) and spatial analysis software has prompted interest in employing geomorphometric techniques to investigate the marine environment. Over the last decade or so, a multitude of geomorphometric techniques (e.g. terrain attributes, feature extraction, automated classification) have been applied to characterize seabed terrain from the coastal zone to the deep sea. Geomorphometric techniques are, however, not as varied, nor as extensively applied, in marine as they are in terrestrial environments. This is at least partly due to difficulties associated with capturing, classifying, and validating terrain characteristics underwater. There is, nevertheless, much common ground between terrestrial and marine geomorphometry applications and it is important that, in developing marine geomorphometry, we learn from experiences in terrestrial studies. However, not all terrestrial solutions can be adopted by marine geomorphometric studies since the dynamic, four-dimensional (4-D) nature of the marine environment causes its own issues throughout the geomorphometry workflow. For instance, issues with underwater positioning, variations in sound velocity in the water column affecting acoustic-based mapping, and our inability to directly observe and measure depth and morphological features on the seafloor are all issues specific to the application of geomorphometry in the marine environment. Such issues fuel the need for a dedicated scientific effort in marine geomorphometry.{$<$}/br{$><$}/br{$>$}This review aims to highlight the relatively recent growth of marine geomorphometry as a distinct discipline, and offers the first comprehensive overview of marine geomorphometry to date. We address all the five main steps of geomorphometry, from data collection to the application of terrain attributes and features. We focus on how these steps are relevant to marine geomorphometry and also highlight differences and similarities from terrestrial geomorphometry. We conclude with recommendations and reflections on the future of marine geomorphometry. To ensure that geomorphometry is used and developed to its full potential, there is a need to increase awareness of (1) marine geomorphometry amongst scientists already engaged in terrestrial geomorphometry, and of (2) geomorphometry as a science amongst marine scientists with a wide range of backgrounds and experiences.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Despite many of years of mapping effort, only a small fraction of the world ocean’s seafloor has been sampled for depth, greatly limiting our ability to explore and understand critical ocean and seafloor processes. Recognizing this poor state of our knowledge of ocean depths and the critical role such knowledge plays in understanding and maintaining our planet, GEBCO and the Nippon Foundation have joined forces to establish the Nippon Foundation GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project, an international effort with the objective of facilitating the complete mapping of the world ocean by 2030. The Seabed 2030 Project will establish globally distributed regional data assembly and coordination centers (RDACCs) that will identify existing data from their assigned regions that are not currently in publicly available databases and seek to make these data available. They will develop protocols for data collection (including resolution goals) and common software and other tools to assemble and attribute appropriate metadata as they assimilate regional grids using standardized techniques. A Global Data Assembly and Coordination Center (GDACC) will integrate the regional grids into a global grid and distribute to users world-wide. The GDACC will also act as the central focal point for the coordination of common data standards and processing tools as well as the outreach coordinator for Seabed 2030 efforts. The GDACC and RDACCs will collaborate with existing data centers and bathymetric compilation efforts. Finally, the Nippon Foundation GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project will encourage and help coordinate and track new survey efforts and facilitate the development of new and innovative technologies that can increase the efficiency of seafloor mapping and thus make the ambitious goals of Seabed 2030 more likely to be achieved.},

Several types of outlier detection algorithms are developed and a number of surveys and overviews are performed to distinguish their advantages and disadvantages. Multivariate outlier detection algorithms are widely used among other types, therefore we concentrate on this type. In this work a comparison between effects of multivariate outlier detection algorithms on machine learning problems is performed. For this purpose, three multivariate outlier detection algorithms namely distance based, statistical based and clustering based are evaluated. Benchmark datasets of Heart disease, Breast cancer and Liver disorder are used for the experiments. To identify the effectiveness of mentioned algorithms, the above datasets are classified by Support Vector Machines (SVM) before and after outlier detection. Finally a comparative review is performed to distinguish the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm and their respective effects on accuracy of SVM classifiers.},

We propose a method to approach this problem by trying to estimate a function f that is positive on S and negative on the complement. The functional form of f is given by a kernel expansion in terms of a potentially small subset of the training data; it is regularized by controlling the length of the weight vector in an associated feature space. The expansion coefficients are found by solving a quadratic programming problem, which we do by carrying out sequential optimization over pairs of input patterns. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the statistical performance of our algorithm.             The algorithm is a natural extension of the support vector algorithm to the case of unlabeled data.},

  abstract = {Outlier detection is a key element for intelligent financial surveillance systems which intend to identify fraud and money laundering by discovering unusual customer behaviour pattern. The detection procedures generally fall into two categories: comparing every transaction against its account history and further more, comparing against a peer group to determine if the behavior is unusual. The later approach shows particular merits in efficiently extracting suspicious transaction and reducing false positive rate. Peer group analysis concept is largely dependent on a cross-datasets outlier detection model. In this paper, we propose a new cross outlier detection model based on distance definition incorporated with the financial transaction data features. An approximation algorithm accompanied with the model is provided to optimize the computation of the deviation from tested data point to the reference dataset. An experiment based on real bank data blended with synthetic outlier cases shows promising results of our model in reducing false positive rate while enhancing the discriminative rate remarkably},
